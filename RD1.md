* A challenge i encountered was  knowing how to strip the brackets and quotations away and improving the HCI
* We overcame them by troubleshooting and using class notes to figure out how to strip brackets from our lists of lists.
* A key take away I have is the importance of having good notes and communication with my partner 
* I learned what I was supposed to from this assigment as i gained confidence in dealing with dictionarys 
* My partner was very knowledgable on this topic and worked very hard to make our code the best. I learned a lot from working with him as he understood the content on a level i did not and was able to teach me as we worked on this project together
